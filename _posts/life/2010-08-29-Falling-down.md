where has she gone

where are you going   as you have made so many mistakes

no body care where did you come from

you are just like an avariciousness in their mind

never be intended to ask why it has being going on

she has not believe you ever or never

when you come

please fall down

if that day comes again

bring her heart into your mind and then fall down

there is no body to care the reason

falling down just like a missilery

falling down only like the numb tears

falling down just like a meteor

falling down only like the broken heart
