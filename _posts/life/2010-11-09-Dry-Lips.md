when you’re feeling good,I passed.

I look you in my eyes,

forever it’s never the road goes end.

don’t lost yourself,they has been digging you.

you said embracing brought dry lips to you.

life could not give you sunshine,

dry lips,dry lips

lost in the dry season.

I touch them,feel them gently.

saying I come for you, listening to you

don’t be afraid,

the dry season passes away since you meet me again

dry lips,dry lips

passed away,passed away.
